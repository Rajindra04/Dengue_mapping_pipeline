Sample Sheet Generator
The Sample Sheet Generator is a Python script that automates the generation of a sample sheet from FASTQ files. The sample sheet is a tab-separated file that contains essential information about the samples and their corresponding read files.
Features
•	Automatically scans a specified directory and its subdirectories for FASTQ files.
•	Generates a sample sheet with sample names and paths to the corresponding read files.
•	Excludes samples that do not have both Read 1 and Read 2 files present.
•	Provides a command-line interface for easy execution.
Prerequisites
•	Python: Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
•	Required Libraries: The script uses the argparse and os libraries, which are included in the standard Python library.
Usage
To use the Sample Sheet Generator, follow these steps:
1.	Download the create_samplesheet.py script from the repository.
2.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
3.	Run the script using the following command:
shellCopy code
python create_samplesheet.py <directory> <sample_sheet_file> 
Replace <directory> with the path to the directory containing the FASTQ files, and <sample_sheet_file> with the desired output sample sheet file path.
Output
The script generates a sample sheet file in the following format:
Copy code
sample_name read1 read2 
Each line represents a sample and contains the following information:
•	sample_name: The name of the sample, extracted from the FASTQ file name.
•	read1: The path to the corresponding Read 1 file (ends with _R1_).
•	read2: The path to the corresponding Read 2 file (ends with _R2_).
Please note that the script will only include samples in the sample sheet that have both Read 1 and Read 2 files present. Samples with missing read files will be excluded from the sample sheet.

Map Reads
The Map Reads script is a Python script that automates read mapping using the BWA-MEM2 aligner. It simplifies the process of read trimming, quality control, and read mapping to multiple reference genomes.
Features
•	Trims reads using Fastp for better alignment results.

•	Maps reads to multiple reference genomes using BWA-MEM2.
•	Generates SAM files for each reference genome.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the following:
•	BWA-MEM2: Install BWA-MEM2 and ensure it is accessible in your system's PATH.
•	Fastp: Install Fastp and ensure it is accessible in your system's PATH.
•	FastQC: Install FastQC and ensure it is accessible in your system's PATH.
Usage
To use the Map Reads script, follow these steps:
1.	Ensure you have the sample_sheet_generator.py script available. This script generates the sample sheet file required by the Map Reads script.
2.	Create a sample sheet file using the sample_sheet_generator.py script.
3.	Download the map_reads.py script from the repository.
4.	Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the script.
5.	Run the script using the following command:
shellCopy code
python map_reads.py --samplesheet <samplesheet_path> 
Replace <samplesheet_path> with the path to the sample sheet file generated by the Sample Sheet Generator script.
Output
The script performs the following steps for each sample in the sample sheet:
1.	Trimming: Uses Fastp to trim the reads and generates trimmed read files for each sample.
2.	FastQC: Performs quality control on the trimmed reads using FastQC and generates reports.
3.	Mapping: Uses BWA-MEM2 to map the trimmed reads to multiple reference genomes. Generates SAM files for each reference genome.
The SAM files are moved to the designated directory within the script's base directory.
